                                              Each of these libraries is imported and what role they play in a typical text classification or data science workflow:

pandas: For data manipulation and loading datasets (DataFrame structures).

seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization (correlation heatmaps, bar charts, etc.).

re: For text preprocessing using regular expressions.

wordcloud.WordCloud: For generating word clouds to visualize word frequency in text data.
sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: To split the dataset into training and testing sets.

sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer: Converts text to numerical features using Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression: A linear classifier suitable for text classification tasks.

sklearn.metrics: For evaluating model performance (accuracy_score, classification_report).

sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier: A tree-based model for classification.

sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier: An ensemble of decision trees, often more accurate and less prone to overfitting.
